# Neovim configuration notes.

## Tasks
- [ ] Split configuration in an understandable manner.
- [ ] Some Linux config related, as Treesitter sintax for bash are no needed
      in Windows installations.


## Issues

## Testing
- [ ] Let's test obsidian plugin

## Quarantine
- [ ] Do I want Highlights all occurs of word under cursor like VSCode?
init.lua:430
- [ ] Inlay Hints are now configured as a toggle thing. I Don't like it too
much, surely I'll have to take care of disable it completely.
- [ ] I think *autoformat* stuff is confiured to work automatically. I think
I dont't like this, but for now It will be under quarantine. init.lua:550
- [ ] Do I want <Ctrl+y> used to insert current selected autocompletion
suggestion?
- [ ] I'm not sure if I really want all the conceallevel zig apply for all
files, it could cause some issues.
