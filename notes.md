## Tasks

- [ ] Configure general tabs to 4 spaces.
- [ ] Split configuration in an undestandable manner.


## Issues
- [ ] Fuzzy search in opened buffers doesn't work at 3-8-24


## Quarantine
- [ ] Do I want Highlights all occurs of word under cursor like VSCode?
init.lua:430
- [ ] Do I want cursorline? It is too intrusive with this colorshceme.
I'll leave it disabled for now. You can also configured this color only.
- [ ] Inlay Hints are now configured as a toggle thing. I Don't like it too
much, surely I'll have to take care of disable it completely.
- [ ] I think *autoformat* stuff is confiured to work automatically. I think
I dont't like this, but for now It will be under quarantine. init.lua:550
